The Energy Demand Observatory and Laboratory (EDOL) is a 5-year EPSRC funded research programme (Jan 2023 – Jan 2028). 

EDOL’s aims are to

1. enable and strengthen foundational scientific understanding of how and why energy is used in homes through data-rich sociotechnical research.
2. deliver applied research and modelling flexibly and responsively to a fast-moving technological and policy landscape. 
3. make representative and reliable data available to scientists, industry and policymakers.
4. sustain the UK's world-leading research in data-driven approaches to energy data collection, analysis and access.
5. innovate new, cost-effective smart data solutions for collecting energy data at scale. 


EDOL will establish world-class Observatory of 2,000 representative GB homes with high resolution, longitudinal, technical and social data disaggregated to the level of activities, appliances, and occupants. Participant and data management is led by University College London.
The instrumentation for this Observatory will be overseen in the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford. Only instruments that meet our requirements for cost, reliability, un-intrusiveness, scalability and privacy, will get deployed in the Observatory.
Alongside the Observatory, EDOL will commission several Laboratories for evaluation of technologies, business models and policy interventions. These Laboratories are expected to be on a scale of 100-200 homes and give early career researchers an opportunity to lead projects withing the EDOL programme.
Data from Observatory and Laboratories will be analysed at Oxford and processed to be shared with academics, policy makers and practitioners. 
Unexplained energy demand patterns and other anomalies will be investigated in Forensic studies, with in-depth ethnographic instruments and in-person observations. This work is led by Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute.

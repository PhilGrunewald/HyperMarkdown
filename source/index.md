All folders that contain a `index.html` file are included in the Menu above. Other pages can be linked like [Folder3/text1](Folder3/text1.html).

By adding `%box` to a markdown link, the page is linked as a box:

[Folder3/text1](Folder3/text1.html)%box

Any `html` pages within the same folder are listed as boxes.

![Image caption]($img/icon.png)%icon
